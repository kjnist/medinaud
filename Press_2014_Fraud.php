                <p>
                    Please be advised we have been notified of a fraud hoax attempting to be 
                    perpetrated on Medina County homeowners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two property owners contacted us today relating that they had received phone
                    calls from someone identifying themselves being from the "Department of the
                    Treasurer, Legal Affairs."  The caller then quickly indicated there was a
                    lien on the homeowner's property and asked if they had a criminal attorney.
                    The phone call soon went to a request to send money to prevent police action.
                    There was an attempt by the phone caller to keep the residents on the line
                    for a long period of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "This is a fraud that has been perpetrated in other parts of the country," 
                    Kovack said, "But it's the first time we've seen it here."  He indicated 
                    the homeowners said the caller spoke broken English, making it difficult 
                    to understand.  Additionally, when questions were asked, the caller would 
                    put the homeowner on hold for a period of time before returning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kovack warned Medina County residents to remember not to give out any
                    personal information to inquiries such as this over the phone, "and never
                    make arrangements to send money to a phone call out of the blue like this."
                    Kovack advised anyone receiving phone calls to contact their local law 
                    enforcement agency.
