                    Michael E. Kovack, Medina County Auditor, announced today that his office 
                    will again be offering a $500 scholarship to a graduating senior in a 
                    vocational program at the Medina County Career Center or Wadsworth High 
                    School or a home schooler planning on pursuing further education in a 
                    vocational field. The scholarship may be used toward tuition, books or other
                    school expenses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr. Kovack said, “I am very proud of my staff. Every year they contribute 
                    money to secure the $500 necessary to offer this scholarship. They look 
                    forward to reading the applications and awarding the scholarship to a 
                    student on the basis of sincerity in furthering one’s education, need, 
                    student citizenship and school/community involvement.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of the requirement of a vocational major, a student interested in 
                    applying may pick up the scholarship application at the Medina County Career 
                    Center or at Wadsworth High School or at the Auditor’s Office, 144 North 
                    Broadway, Room 306, Medina. Students may also go on line and download the 
                    application and rules from the Forms Link at Auditor Kovack’s web site
