                    Mike Kovack, Medina County Auditor, announced the kick-off of his annual 
                    Memorial Day Essay Contest for all sixth, seventh and eighth grade level 
                    students living in Medina County. The Memorial Day Contest is in partnership
                    with the Wadsworth Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 1089.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students have the choice of five different topics to choose from for their 
                    essay. For a list of topics, please go to:
                    <a href="MemorialDayRules2014.php"></a>www.medinacountyauditor.org/MemorialDayRules2014.php.
                    Only students residing in Medina County are eligible. Entries MUST contain 
                    the student’s name address, name of parent(s), phone number and email 
                    (if applicable). Essays should be no longer than 750 words and will be 
                    judged on ability to express thought, clarity of writing, spelling, grammar
                    and overall impact. First, second and third place, from each grade level,

                    Auditor Kovack said, “As a retired naval officer, I hold our military in high
                    esteem. I think this essay contest gives young people the chance to learn 
                    more about our history and the bravery of so many of our military personnel.
                    It also gives students the opportunity to learn more about our country’s great
                    history.”
