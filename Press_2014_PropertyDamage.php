                    We can help! Make sure to fill out a Destroyed or Damaged property form with our 
                    office! This will take the destroyed value off next year's taxes! You must file 
                    the form to get this credit, because we're not aware of all the storm damage across
                    the county; access the form at <a href="forms.php">http://www.medinacountyauditor.org/forms.htm</a>
                    Please note this form must be filed by the end of the year to get the full credit
                    so don't delay!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note credit for damage ONLY applies to real property - that on which 
                    you pay real property taxes. Trees, bushes, cars are not valued for real 
                    property purposes. Please call with questions at 330-725-9754.
