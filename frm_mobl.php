                <p>
                    If you own a Manufactured or Mobile Home purchased before January 1, 2000,
                    you may choose one of two methods of taxation. The first is the Depreciation
                    Method. With this method homeowners are taxed using a method of depreciation
                    and the full tax rate. This tax rate is not subject to H. B. 920 reduction
                    factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your home is purchased or transferred after January 1, 2000, or if you 
                    elect to convert to it, you may use the Appraised Method which means the 
                    property is taxed like real property. Under the Appraised Method, all homes
                    will be appraised for market value by the County Auditor, similar to how 
                    real property is valued. These values will be adjusted every three (3) years
                    on the same schedule as real property.
                </p>

                    If you are sure you want to convert to the new Appraised Method, all taxes 
                    must be paid and a form is required to be filed with the Auditor's Office.
                    You may download that form from this site.
