                    Medina County Auditor Mike Kovack, announced today that for the twenty-first
                    consecutive year, his office has been awarded the Excellence in Financial 
                    Reporting award from the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA). 
                    The Certificate of Achievement is the highest form of recognition in the 
                    area of governmental accounting and financial reporting, and its attainment
                    represents a significant accomplishment by a government and its management.
                    Ohio Tax Commissioner Joe Testa presented the award to Kovack during 
                    ceremonies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Auditor Kovack has received this award every year he has been in office and 
                    said, “I feel this award is a great testimony to the high standards we have 
                    established and achieved in this office. I am very appreciative of this 
                    special recognition from the GFOA.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ms. Sharon Creswell, Accounting Department Supervisor, along with Marybeth
                    Guenther and Erin Roberts, are responsible for preparing the CAFR each year.
                    “We are especially appreciative of all the hard work and commitment these 
                    three deputies devote to this project each year,” Kovack said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The CAFR was judged by an impartial panel of financial experts to meet the
                    high standards of the program including demonstrating a constructive “spirit
                    of full disclosure” to clearly communicate its financial story and motivate
                    potential users and user groups to read the CAFR.
                </p>
                <p>
