                    The Board of Revision Complaint Form is a formal appeal of the appraised
                    value of real property.  According to state law, these forms must be filed
                    with the auditor's office no later than March 31, in order to be considered.  After a Board of Revision Appeal is filed, a hearing will be scheduled with the board.

                <p>
                    The Board of Revision's only function is to determine the true market value 
                    (estimated selling price) of property.  Please keep in mind, it does not deal with
                    taxes or tax rates for your property or the appraised value of your neighbor's 
                    property.  Only recent sale values of properties in your area will be used to put
                    an assessed value on your property. The board will take into consideration any 
                    unique aspects of your property.  The Board of Revision can raise, as well as lower,
                    your appraised value based on recent sales in your area.  Be advised that by
                    Ohio law, the burden of proof to establish market value is on the property
                    owner.
